<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a premium, minimalist, and emotionally-driven Shopify storefront for a brand named LUMEI, which sells amethyst ambient LED lamps. The brand's philosophy is selling identity through light, not just a product.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Design Language:** Dark-mode first, premium, minimal, with a neutral palette where the lamp's light provides the color contrast.
2.  **Inspiration:** Use  for conversion psychology and decision clarity only. DO NOT copy its layout, visuals, or brand elements.
3.  **Content Tone:** Avoid spiritual or metaphysical language. The copy should be short, confident, and calm.
4.  **Homepage Structure:** Must include a Hero section, Concept Section, Variants as Identity Section, How It Lives in Your Space section, Social Proof, and a minimal FAQ.
5.  **Product Page:** Must be variant-first (e.g., LUMEI - CALM), with an emotional description and collapsed technical specs.
6.  **Trust Elements:** The site must include trust signals like secure payment icons, a 30-day return policy, a satisfaction guarantee, and clear shipping information. These should be subtle and premium.
7.  **CRITICAL - Shopify Editability:** The entire theme MUST be built with Shopify OS 2.0 sections and blocks. The merchant must have full control to edit text, reorder/hide sections, and manage content from the Shopify Theme Editor. No hardcoded content.
8.  **Final Deliverable:** A fully functional, importable Shopify theme in a  file.

**User's preferred language**: Español

**what currently exists?**
A React prototype was initially built to establish the visual design and layout. Based on that, a Shopify theme structure has been created under . This includes various Liquid files for sections, templates, and snippets. A  file was generated and placed in  for download.

However, the user tested this theme and reported critical bugs. The agent has started the process of fixing these by creating new template files and updating existing Liquid sections.

**Last working item**:
The agent was actively fixing the broken Shopify theme based on user feedback.

-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the process of fixing multiple issues simultaneously. Specifically, it had just created new templates for static pages (like FAQ and policies) and was about to update the  file to include all the payment methods requested by the user, and then download and integrate product images into the theme's assets.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N (Testing was performed on the React prototype, but the user confirmed the actual Shopify theme is broken. The current fixes have not been tested.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing. The agent must meticulously review the Liquid code, JSON templates, and file paths. After fixing, the agent should regenerate the  file and provide a new download link, instructing the user to test by uploading it to their Shopify store, as this is the only way to confirm full functionality.
-   **User Testing Done:** Y (User tested the previous theme version and confirmed it is not functional).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
This list is based on the user's most recent feedback and is critical to resolve.

-   **Issue 1 (P0): Product Page Inaccessible**
-   **Issue 2 (P0): Images Not Displaying in the Theme**
-   **Issue 3 (P1): Static Content Pages Lead to 404 Errors**
-   **Issue 4 (P1): Incomplete Payment Method Icons**
-   **Issue 5 (P2): General Shopify Theme Functionality**

**Issues Detail:**

-   **Issue 1: Product Page Inaccessible**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None yet. The agent was focused on content pages and payment icons first.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Inspect  or the relevant homepage section (, ) to check the link () pointing to the product page.
        2.  Ensure the link correctly uses the Shopify product object URL, e.g., .
        3.  Verify that  and  exist and are correctly configured.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical bug blocking the main user journey. Fixing it will allow users to navigate from the homepage to the product page.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via user testing the Shopify theme).

-   **Issue 2: Images Not Displaying in the Theme**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent was about to start working on this by downloading the image.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Download all necessary images (product lamp, lifestyle shots).
        2.  Place the images in the  directory.
        3.  In all Liquid files (e.g., , ), ensure image URLs are generated using the Liquid  filter (e.g., ).
        4.  Make sure the image file names in the code match the files in the  folder exactly.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The product is visual. Without images, the store is unusable. This will restore the visual identity of the brand.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via user testing the Shopify theme).

-   **Issue 3: Static Content Pages Lead to 404 Errors**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent created new template files (, , etc.) and corresponding section files (, etc.).
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify that the links in the navigation and footer (, ) point to the correct page handles (e.g., ).
        2.  Ensure that in the Shopify admin (which we can't access, so we must assume), pages with these handles would be created by the user and assigned the corresponding new templates. The instructions for the user must be clear.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete the site structure and provide essential information to customers, building trust and preventing dead ends.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via user testing the Shopify theme).

-   **Issue 4: Incomplete Payment Method Icons**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent created a  snippet but has not yet added all the icons requested by the user.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Reference the image provided by the user in message #91.
        2.  Add SVG code or image assets for all missing payment methods (e.g., Klarna, Amex, Bizum, etc.) to the  snippet and potentially the  directory.
        3.  Ensure these are displayed correctly in the footer and on the product page.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Increases customer trust by showing all accepted payment methods.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via user testing the Shopify theme).

-   **Issue 5: General Shopify Theme Functionality**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent is addressing this by fixing the specific issues above.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Review all section files ( in ).
        2.  Ensure each section has a valid  with Shopify-editable settings for all text, images, and other content.
        3.  Confirm that JSON templates () correctly reference these sections and their blocks.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This addresses the user's core requirement that the theme is 100% manageable from the Shopify editor.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (The agent's initial approach did not produce a functional Shopify theme).

**In progress Task List**:
The only task is to fix the theme, which covers all the issues above.
-   **Task 1: Create a Fully Functional and Editable Shopify Theme**
    -   **Where to resume:** Continue the work started in the last turn: update , download and correctly reference all images in the  folder, add all payment methods, and ensure all navigation links work.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A complete, bug-free, and importable Shopify theme that meets all user requirements.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (user must test the final ).
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   Advanced product page image gallery with multiple angles.
-   (Out of scope for theme) Payment processing integration.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Designed the UI/UX for the LUMEI brand via a React prototype.
-   Implemented a dark-mode, premium, and minimal aesthetic.
-   Created the initial (though buggy) Shopify theme structure with sections, templates, and snippets.
-   Added trust and reassurance elements (guarantees, return policy) to the design.
-   Generated a  archive for the theme.

**Code Architecture**
-   : React application, used as a visual prototype.
-   : The main workspace for the Shopify theme.
    -   : For images, CSS, and JS. **(Needs to be populated with product images)**
    -   :  and  for global theme settings.
    -   :  (main layout file).
    -   : Reusable Liquid modules for the theme editor (e.g., ).
    -   : Reusable code snippets (e.g., ).
    -   : JSON templates that define the layout of pages (, , ).

**All files of reference**
-   All files within . This is the directory containing the deliverable.
-   : The deliverable file that needs to be fixed and regenerated.
-   The user-provided image of payment methods: 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your primary focus is the  directory. The React app in  is only a visual reference.
-   The user's last feedback (message #91) is a critical bug report. You must address ALL points: broken product page navigation, missing images, 404 pages, and incomplete payment methods.
-   The core requirement is that EVERYTHING must be editable through the Shopify Theme Editor. Double-check your  definitions in every section file.
-   All image paths in Liquid files must use the  filter and reference files that you will place in the  directory.
-   After fixing all issues, you must regenerate the  file.
-   Final verification can only be done by the user uploading the theme to their Shopify store. You must state this clearly in your summary.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The main deliverable, the Shopify theme (), is not functional according to the user's latest feedback.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent initially forgot to:
1.  Properly structure the Shopify theme for functionality, focusing too much on the React prototype's visual correctness.
2.  Include image files in the theme's  folder and use the correct Liquid  filter.
3.  Create the necessary templates for static content pages (FAQ, Policies), causing 404 errors.
4.  Thoroughly check navigation links within the Shopify theme structure, leading to a broken product page link.</analysis>
